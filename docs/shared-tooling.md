# Shared Tooling adoption

IC Timers adopts reviewed revision [`cb86188c5956866564de4fb6ec6be67b27981ab9`](https://github.com/dragginzgame/shared-tooling/tree/cb86188c5956866564de4fb6ec6be67b27981ab9).
The [snapshot manifest](../.shared-tooling.snapshot) records twenty-two exact files,
including [the baseline](../DRAGGINZGAME.md), linked governance, release and
validation runners and verification fixtures. [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) owns the product overlay and the
maintainer-approved validation and release-authority exceptions.

Refresh through the upstream distribution helper from a clean reviewed checkout,
then verify `bash scripts/ci/verify-shared-tooling-snapshot.sh`. CI and releases
use the offline snapshot; a mutable sibling checkout supplies no authority.
The former document-only copy under `docs/shared-tooling/` is retired.

The shared runner owns the three standard SemVer entry points, ordering, Git
operations and exact-version recovery. Consumer adapters retain the five release
metadata outputs, package identity, README projection, both lockfiles and the
complete PocketIC release gate. Publishing remains a separate command.
Normal targets restart preflight/validation failures on current source and
reconcile saved preparation intent before choosing a new increment. Once a
release is committed, newer descendant fixes or a different requested increment
cause the runner to finish that release, then validate the requested next one.
Late local checks read metadata from `RELEASE_COMMIT`, using the current adapter
and existing metadata owners; they never execute scripts from the selected old
tree. Standalone tag and publication guards still require the tag at HEAD.
Local preflight inspects the index and working files independently; commit
admission requires only the five release outputs in the index, matching the
prepared working files. The canonical validation runner retains raw release-gate
failures under the Git directory across retries, including temporary-log fallback
when the retention destination fails. Full gate membership and ordering remain.
The local retry wrapper and its duplicate fixtures are removed.
The shared formatting hook and installer are vendored unchanged. Local formatting
targets sort both workspace catalogs and format Rust; explicit setup and hosted
CI use `cargo-sort` 2.1.4 from [tool-versions.env](../tool-versions.env).
The existing two-workspace release boundary and independently centralized
dependency catalogs remain explicit in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).
The numbered pending changelog follows the new shared version-selection rules;
package mutation and validation authority remain maintainer-owned.
The [host matrix](releasing.md#host-support) owns native qualification: Linux
syntax and command-stub passes do not qualify macOS or live IC execution.

The previous `f52c0e2` adoption's 20-file snapshot, shell syntax and
metadata-preserving manifest formatting checks retain their historical scope.
Both refreshes export committed bytes from clean temporary checkouts. At initial
inspection, later sibling edits were dirty and excluded. Once those changes
were committed at `cb86188`, their source was reviewed and exported separately;
no dirty bytes were copied. The expanded file set was exported to an owned
temporary consumer, then installed only after verifying that the prior snapshot
still matched its manifest. The linked maintenance rule, formatting-hook failure
fix and validation logger are vendored unchanged. The GitHub description was
inspected and matches the current purpose.

The matching upstream [CI run](https://github.com/dragginzgame/shared-tooling/actions/runs/37428740374)
passed on Linux and both macOS 15 architectures at `9437bab`. That qualifies
upstream's fixtures, not this consumer's adapters or live release effects.
The later [upstream run](https://github.com/dragginzgame/shared-tooling/actions/runs/37431805988)
for `cb86188` passed Linux regression and lint/security, but both macOS jobs
failed in snapshot-distribution fixtures with `source is not a Git checkout`.
Their logs show the validation runner, installer and formatting-hook tests
passing first; the later metadata fixture was not reached. Source review
indicates a logical `/var` versus physical `/private/var` mismatch between the
fixture's fake source identity and the refresh helper's canonical path. That is
a diagnosis, not an executed reproduction. The distribution helper/fixture are
not part of this consumer's offline snapshot, and its verification still passes.
This result qualifies the shared logger fixture on both native hosts but does
not qualify the complete upstream batch or this consumer's changed adapters.
An upstream fixture correction and matching rerun remain necessary; no upstream
source or GitHub issue was changed during this consumer investigation.
Consumer scope, pending fixture/native qualification and artifact preservation
belong in the [release guide](releasing.md#standard-release-runner), addressing
[#10](https://github.com/dragginzgame/ic-timers/issues/10). No tests, release
execution or upstream mutation were performed during this refresh. Hook
activation remains a separate maintainer setup action.

The 0.13.0 release uses published registry `ic-metrics 0.1.3` in the root
dependency catalog and both lockfiles, with one resolved registry package per
workspace. The temporary sibling path and local 0.1.1 selection belong to the
earlier extraction, superseded by
[registry adoption](https://github.com/dragginzgame/ic-timers/issues/9). Its
initial focused library check reported an unused-assignment warning in separate
delivery-retirement work; that historical result does not qualify the current
runtime. Later focused evidence is scoped in the [handoff](status/current.md).

Focused measurement tests passed for role-specific accounting and registration
identity during extraction. Subsequent unrelated delivery-retirement changes
retain their own validation owner; these results do not qualify those changes.
